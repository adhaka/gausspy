This is a package which will contain several possible implementations of Gaussian Process- the basic vanilla version and the various approximation techniques like James Hensman-Variational Inferenc(SVI-GP), Marc Deisenroth scheme of using Distributed GPs and the recent KISS-GPs. This is for my personal learning and to know the challenges of implementing these techniques. I will also run checks for speed and computational memory requirements for each of the approximations
